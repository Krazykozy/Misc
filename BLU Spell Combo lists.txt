This set provides you with all of the DD traits you'll need to deal the most damage that you can while leaving open some points for utility. You could set Frightful Roar, Magic Fruit, Cocoon, or other such spells to bolster your defensive and offensive support abilities with as little as one job point spent.

This is an improved version of the standard DD spec. It adds additional an accuracy bonus trait and numerous utility spells while retaining Dual Wield III, Triple Attack, and Store TP. If the extra accuracy is unnecessary, you can remove Vanity Dive and Frenetic Rip for spells like Barrier Tusk, Whirl of Rage, and Dream Flower for additional utility and HP or Battery Charge if you feel that MP will become an issue.

With maximum Job Points into blue magic set points and the level 100 Gift, this spell set ends up giving you Dual Wield IV, Triple Attack, Store TP III, Accuracy Bonus II, Critical Attack Bonus II, Skillchain Bonus II and other minor traits. Needless to say, a veritable bevy of powerful traits that indirectly affect gearing. With ideal gear, this is the best spellset for out and out DDing until you hit get your second job trait bonus.

Nature’s Meditation

Tenebral Crush

This set will give you a colossal amount of stopping power. Dual Wield IV, Store TP IV, Skillchain Bonus III, Critical Attack Bonus III, Triple Attack, and Accuracy Bonus III are your primary DD traits. The set also gives you a powerful buff in the form of Nature’s Meditation and an excellent defense down with Tenebral Crush. You will have 7 set points remaining to do with as you wish. Personally, I tailor the remaining points to either fill in the gaps of utility when playing lowman, with spells like Winds of Promy or White Wind, or to set stronger DD traits, such as Attack Bonus III or an additional Accuracy tier, when playing in a large group. With properly optimized gear, this set is the absolute best you can use for physical damage.

Charged Whisker
Evryone. Grudge
Amorphic Spikes

Provides Treasure Hunter, buffs, a moderate amount of AoE damage, and a bevy of offensive traits to facilitate efficient Dynamis farming. Do not fear for the lack of healing spells, Sanguine Blade is particularly effective in Dynamis and is the primary tool used for healing if it ever becomes necessary. If you have some job points, you can add and change around additional spells to this set to increase your effectiveness even further. For example, Thrashing Assault to bump DA up to TA, or Benthic Typhoon/Subduction for more AoE damage (and in the case of Subduction, stronger Sanguine Blades).

This set is designed specifically for cleaving. It allows you to deal with any scenario that requires AoE damage while preserving yourself and offering a wide array of defensive benefit. Add or remove elemental nukes depending on what your targets are weak to. With job points, you can add additional spells to this set to increase single target damage or survivability.
